# [Youth Cyber Program Website](https://cyber-afterschool.anvil.app/)

Welcome to the **Youth Cyber Program Website**, a modular platform developed to support an afterschool program focused on teaching middle school students fundamental cyber concepts and skills. This website was created to inspire young learners to explore technology and cybersecurity through interactive projects and hands-on challenges.

The site is designed to grow and evolve as the program expands, with new projects being added over time. It was built entirely by me using **Anvil**, with customized **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to create a dynamic and engaging experience.

## Features

- **AI Face Scanning & Mapping Application**: Built using TensorFlow's BlazeFace model, this app allows students to draw on a digital canvas and see their artwork mapped to their tracked face in real-time. It provides an exciting, interactive introduction to AI and computer vision.

- **Scratch Coding Applications**: Embedded applications from [Scratch.mit.edu](https://scratch.mit.edu) enable students to learn basic coding concepts through visual programming. These exercises help build a strong foundation in programming logic.

- **Cybersecurity Challenges**: Students can participate in various challenges related to **encryption**, **password protection**, and **phishing awareness**, helping them understand essential security practices.

## Modular Design

The modular structure of the website ensures that it can be easily updated as the program grows. New projects and challenges can be seamlessly added, making the site scalable and adaptable for future needs.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Custom HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Backend**: Anvil framework

## Key Highlights

- **Interactive Learning**: Each project is designed to engage students and spark their interest in cybersecurity and technology.
  
- **Real-Time AI Interaction**: The face scanning app combines fun and learning, demonstrating how AI can be applied in creative ways.
  
- **Future-Proof**: The modular design of the site allows for easy expansion as the program evolves and new projects are developed.

## How to Use

- **Explore Projects**: Use the navigation menu to discover various projects, from coding basics to advanced AI applications.
  
- **Interactive AI App**: Try out the real-time face scanning and mapping application, and see how your drawings are mapped to your face!
  
- **Take on Challenges**: Test your cybersecurity knowledge with interactive challenges on encryption, password security, and more.
